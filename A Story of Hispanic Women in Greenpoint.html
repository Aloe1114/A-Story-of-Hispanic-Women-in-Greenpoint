        <h1>A Story of Hispanic Women in Greenpoint, Brooklyn</h1>
        <h5>By Hui Lu </h5>
        <p>Greenpoint, located in Brooklyn, New York City, is famous for its history of industry and Polish culture. 
            In this neighborhood, nearly half of  the local population are American white people, and Hispanic, about 13% in total, are the second largest group in this neighborhood. </p>
        <h3> At the Beginning of the Story:</h3>
        <p> When we try to retrieve the growth and life of a woman, what should we care about? </p>
        <p>Family of Origin? Growth Experience? Education Level? Marriage? </p> 
        <img src="women.jpg"width="1380px"height="700px">
        <h4>In our story, I would like to retrieve the factors behind Hispanic women who comes from a poor family and compare to what happened to white women 
            by finding the differences between growth experience, education, employment and incomes.

        <h3>Growth Experience</h3>
        <p>Though both are coming from poor families, Hispanic girls start to raise children much earlier than other groups of women. While white girls are still obsessed with movie stars, worried about boyfriends, 
            grades, and future college life, Hispanic women become mothers.  </p>
        <p> Worse, compared to white women, they have a higher rate of incarceration (nearly 2 times). More or less,the experience in prison casts a shadow over their lives and work.
            But the good point is that they still have a better performance among the whole neighborhood.  </p>

        <h3>Education</h3>
        <p>However, what makes Hispanic women more vulnerable in this society is their education. On less than 80% of women have a high school education diploma, and only 20% have a bachelor degree.
            Not only is it far behind white girls, it's not even close to the average in the neighborhood. Such a gap set the background of their future life, career and spouse.

        <h3>Income and Employment</h3>
        <p>Even Hispanic girls do not generally have high education levels and have more torturous experience compared to white women; they are hard-working, laborious and strong women.
            White women live in a more decent life; they earn a regular amount of income, marry a man who can make money (which is much more than their earning),
            and could be a housewife if they want to. Nevertheless, Hispanic women seem supporting half of their families. They have a higher employment rate compared to white women and other groups;
            plus, they earn as much as white women, while their husbands cannot earn more. </p>

        <h3>In the End of the Story:
        </h3>
        <h4>
            From these Hispanic girls in Greenpoint, it's easy to find that though they are not well educated, and even start to shoulder the burden of their families since they are young,
            they are hard-working and competent, even comparing to more educated white women. 
            Despite a poor start, they still fight for the opportunity to get out of poverty and manage to get out of poverty by themselves.
